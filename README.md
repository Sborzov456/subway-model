<h1> Model of Subway :bullettrain_side: </h1>
  <h2> :pushpin: Short Description: </h2>
  <p>
  With the help of a dialogue program with a console, you can create metro lines and add three types of stations to them: <br> 
  :white_check_mark: Regular station <br>
  :white_check_mark: Station with a transition to another station <br> 
  :white_check_mark: Transfer hub. <br>
  After that, you can display the created metro through the graph visualization program Graphviz.
  </p>
  
  There is a simple example: <br> <br>

    :white_check_mark: Edit station <br>
    :white_check_mark: Print in console <br>
    :white_check_mark: Draw in Graphviz <br>
    :white_check_mark: Run complete test <br> 
  </p>
  
  <h2> :pushpin: Template Array </h2>
  <p>
  The TemplateArray.h file contains two self-written classes: a template array of constant length and an iterator for this class. <br>
    <h3> :heavy_exclamation_mark: Iterator methods: </h3> <br>
    :white_check_mark: Overloaded operator == <br>
    :white_check_mark: Overloaded operator != <br>
    :white_check_mark: Overloaded operator ++ <br>
    :white_check_mark: Overloaded operator * <br>
  </p>
