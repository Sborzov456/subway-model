# Model of Subway :bullettrain_side:
## :pushpin: Short Description:
  With the help of a dialogue program with a console, you can create metro lines and add three types of stations to them:
  
  - [x] **Regular station** 
  - [x] **Station with a transition to another station** 
  - [x] **Transfer hub**
  
  After that, you can display the created metro through the graph visualization program ***Graphviz***.
  There is a simple example:

## :pushpin: Options:
    
  - [x] `add line` 
  - [x] `add station` 
  - [x] `convert type of station` 
  - [x] `edit station` (for example, add a new transition to another station) 
  - [x] `print in console` 
  - [x] `draw in Graphviz` 
  - [x] `run complete test` 
  
## :pushpin: Template Array 
  The TemplateArray.h file contains two self-written classes: a template array of constant length and an iterator for this class. <br>
### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Iterator methods:

  - [x] Overloaded `operator ==`
  - [x] Overloaded `operator !=` 
  - [x] Overloaded `operator ++` 
  - [x] Overloaded `operator *` 
  
### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Array methods: 

  - [x] size (return size of array) 
  - [x] empty (returns true, if array is empty and false otherwise) 
  - [x] full (returns true, if array is full and false otherwise) 
  - [x] find (returns the index of the searched element :heavy_exclamation_mark: WILL WORK ONLY WITH CLASSES WHICH OPERATOR == IS OVERLOADED :heavy_exclamation_mark:)
